-------------
possibilitiesMap - keyed on (allele1, allele2)
each key hashes to a value of int arrays of size 15
These arrays are a simple binary string denoting that they belong to a parent set

In other words, this is a hash map that given an individual's genotype, returns a bitstring which is 1 if the genotype could come from the two parents and 0 if not

-------------
possibilities = array of lists of size 15
each list is all the possible sib types that belong to a parent set (i.e., (1,2),(1,2))

In other words, possibilites is just an array of lists where each list is the siblings-complete.csv in list form.

---
alleles = array of hashmaps of size nloci.  it appears to just be a frequency counter for an allele at each locus.

---

data = the global list of organism where each entry contains the name of the individual and the alleles at each locus for that individual.

sibgroups structure
% allelemappings - hashtable for mapping an allele to 1...n specific to a locus
